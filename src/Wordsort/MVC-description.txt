The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is an architectural design that separates an application into three interconnected parts: the Model, the View, and the Controller. This separation of concerns aims to make applications more organized, maintainable, and scalable. 
Here's a breakdown of each component:
Model:
Represents the application's data and business logic. It manages data, interacts with databases, and handles data validation and manipulation. 
View:
Handles the user interface and presentation of data. It displays information to the user and allows interaction with the application. 
Controller:
Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View. It receives user input, interacts with the Model to process data, and updates the View to reflect the changes. 
Benefits of using MVC:
Separation of Concerns:
Divides the application into distinct components, making it easier to manage and modify. 
Improved Maintainability:
Changes in one component are less likely to affect others, simplifying maintenance and updates. 
Enhanced Scalability:
The modular structure of MVC allows for easier scaling of different parts of the application. 
Better Collaboration:
Frontend developers can focus on the View, while backend developers can work on the Model and Controller. 
Simplified Testing:
Each component can be tested independently, leading to more reliable and robust applications.
